<p class= "hover">SCENE I. Before an alehouse on a heath.
Enter Hostess and SLY</p>


<h6 class= "SLY">
SLY
</h6>
<p class="speech">I'll pheeze you, in faith.</p>
<h6 class="Hostess">
Hostess
</h6>
<p class="speech">A pair of stocks, you rogue!</p>
<h6 class= "SLY">
SLY
</h6>
<p class="speech">
Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in
the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror.
Therefore paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa!
</p>
<h6 class="Hostess">
Hostess
</h6><p class="speech">
You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?</p>
<h6 class="SLY">
SLY
</h6>
<p class="speech">
No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy: go to thy cold
bed, and warm thee.</p>
<h6 class="Hostess">
Hostess
</h6>
<p class="speech">I know my remedy; I must go fetch the
        third--borough.
        Exit</p>

<h6 class="SLY">
SLY
</h6>
<p class="speech">
Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him
by law: I'll not budge an inch, boy: let him come,
and kindly.

Falls asleep

Horns winded. Enter a Lord from hunting, with his train</p>
<h6 class="Lord">
Lord
</h6>
<p class="speech">
Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:
Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd;
And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.
Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?
I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.
</p>
<h6 class="FirstHunstman">
First Huntsman
</h6>
<p class="speech">
Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;
He cried upon it at the merest loss
And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:
Trust me, I take him for the better dog.
</p>
